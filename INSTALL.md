# Installing

This app is in very early stage. Currently, we do not have any thing to release yet, so you'll need to build it yourself.

## Building

You need **Visual Studio 2022** with **Universal Windows Development** workload. Then, open the solution, and build.

Ignore the warning in package manifest, the app will build. It is required to declare it so we got a **App Close Confirmation**.

## Deploy

You can just deploy the app now. Enjoy!
